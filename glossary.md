## Engineering processes

**stack:** The "stack" is the set of individual software components that is used to create a particular application or product. This may be as simple as a single server and client, or may include some combination of operating system, databases, processors, architectural layers, and more. They are called a stack because they are imagined as "layers" that stack on top of one another, with data passing from one layer to another, in the same order every time. (Or at least in a predictable order every time.)

For example, in this program you will learn to make a web application using the "MERN" stack: MongoDB for the database, Express for the server, React as the front-end framework, and Node.js as the runtime environment.

**front end:** The front end of an application is generally considered to be the parts of the application that users interact with, or that process input from users. This includes the "client".

**back end:** The back end of an application are the parts that cannot be accessed directly by a user. This includes databases, servers, APIs, etc.

**full stack:** The term full stack means something includes both the front and back ends, or the entire stack of an application from the top to the bottom layer. This is generally used to refer to individual engineers who can work on both the front and back, or who can build an entire web application independently. At the end of this program, you will be a full stack software engineer!

**parts of the stack:**

- **client**: A client is an application (or device) that accesses information or requests operations from a server. A web browser is an example of a client.
- **server**: A server is an application (or device) that performs operations or processes information upon request. Your email server is an example of a server. It sends and receives emails, and provides information about those emails to the client, which then displays them for you to read.
- **database:** Database refers to either a structured set of data, or a program (such as MongoDB or PostgreSQL) that stores and accesses structured data. "Structured" in this case means that the data has a predictable format, and can be accessed in a predictable way.

## Computer basics

**hardware:** Any element of a computer that is physical. Includes all of the parts of the machine, such as hard drives, processors, video cards, microchips, etc. Hardware also includes all peripherals such as monitors, heyboards, speakers, etc. It refers to computers of all sizes, including phones, tablets, and computerized IoT devices.

**software:** Any program or application that tells the computer what to do. Applies to "big" programs like operating systems and "small" programs like individual apps.

**operating system, OS:** The OS controls the operation of all other applications on a computer. Everything we do on a computer sits on top of the OS. Linux, Windows, MacOS, Android, and iOS are all examples of operating systems.

**filesystem, or file system:** (can be written either way) The OS's system for organizing, managing, accessing, and updating the files on a computer's hard drive.

**hard drive:** Any piece of hardware that is used to store computerized data. Includes the hard disk drive in your computer, the SD card in your phone, USB flash drives, etc.

**terminal:** These words all have slightly different meanings that we will get into later, when we have more context. For now, just be aware that these are all ways we might refer to the `Terminal` or `Git Bash` program on your computer that we will use to make commands directly to your OS.

- terminal
- shell
- console
- command line
- command prompt
