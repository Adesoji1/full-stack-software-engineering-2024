### Engineering processes

**stack:** The "stack" is the set of individual software components that is used to create a particular application or product. This may be as simple as a single server and client, or may include some combination of operating system, databases, processors, architectural layers, and more. They are called a stack because they are imagined as "layers" that stack on top of one another, with data passing from one layer to another, in the same order every time. (Or at least in a predictable order every time.)

For example, in this program you will learn to make a web application using the "MERN" stack: MongoDB for the database, Express for the server, React as the front-end framework, and Node.js as the runtime environment.

**front end:** The front end of an application is generally considered to be the parts of the application that users interact with, or that process input from users. This includes the "client".

**back end:** The back end of an application are the parts that cannot be accessed directly by a user. This includes databases, servers, APIs, etc.

**full stack:** The term full stack means something includes both the front and back ends, or the entire stack of an application from the top to the bottom layer. This is generally used to refer to individual engineers who can work on both the front and back, or who can build an entire web application independently. At the end of this program, you will be a full stack software engineer!

**parts of the stack:**

- **client**: A client is an application (or device) that accesses information or requests operations from a server. A web browser is an example of a client.
- **server**: A server is an application (or device) that performs operations or processes information upon request. Your email server is an example of a server. It sends and receives emails, and provides information about those emails to the client, which then displays them for you to read.
- **database:** Database refers to either a structured set of data, or a program (such as MongoDB or PostgreSQL) that stores and accesses structured data. "Structured" in this case means that the data has a predictable format, and can be accessed in a predictable way.
